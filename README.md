# Diabetes Patients Health Condition Analysis

## Overview

The analysis presented in this report explores various health-related conditions in diabetic, 
prediabetic, and non-diabetic patients. The purpose of this analysis is to identify patterns 
and correlations between diabetes and other health conditions such as BMI, blood 
pressure, cholesterol, and many other factors like smoking and alcohol consumption.

## Main categories
Based on main categories patients' diabetic status: 
- Prediabetes: 6K patients 
- Diabetes: 34K patients 
- No Diabetes: 197K patients 

## Key Findings:

**Prevalence of Diabetes:** Most patients (197K) do not have diabetes, while 34K are diabetic, and 6K are prediabetic, highlighting the need for effective diabetes management.

**BMI Distribution by Age:** Younger patients (age 4) have a higher average BMI (36.16), which declines to 28.43 by age 13, indicating a higher risk of weight-related health issues in younger age groups.

**Gender Distribution:** The distribution of diabetic patients is fairly balanced, with 17.5K males and 16.1K females affected.

**Other Insights:** Older patients (10-13 years) show higher rates of high blood pressure and cholesterol. Healthy eating habits are common, with 63% of non-diabetic patients consuming fruits and 84% eating vegetables. Additionally, 86% of non-diabetic patients report excellent health.


## Implications:

**Healthcare Strategies:** The high prevalence of diabetes suggests a need for targeted prevention programs, early screening, and personalized treatment plans.

**Product Development:** High BMI in younger patients indicates a demand for weight management products, nutrition plans, and fitness programs.

**Marketing & Awareness:** Gender-balanced diabetes distribution presents an opportunity for tailored health campaigns for both men and women.

**Preventive Health Services:** The strong link between age and high blood pressure/cholesterol highlights the need for early intervention strategies, dietary counseling, and wellness programs.
